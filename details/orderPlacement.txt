Order placement process:

1. We have some list of products in our stock
2. A customer looks to the product list, and adds a product into cart.
3. We will store the product the user wants to buy in the localstorage.
4. We then pull the products from the local storage and put them into the cart of the user.
5. Then user goes to cart and clicks on make payment, then we will connect to the external server for the payment (Stripe) and 
the product will be created in the database.
6. At this point the connection between the application server and Stripe will be lost.
7. Since it may take time for the payment to get completed, so we need o update the app that the payment was done and order has been placed.
8. For this we require a webhook, that tells the app that the payment has been successfully processed.
9. Then the order is updated.
