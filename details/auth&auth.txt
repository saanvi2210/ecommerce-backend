Methods available for authentication:
1. Cookie based
2. Token based
3. Session based

** here we will be using json web tokens


Authentication : allowing a user to login into app with correct login details


Authorisation : after a user has logged in what kind sof rights and accesses does the user has

-> since the http server is stateless i does not remember the user logged in, therefore we use a json web token to make the server remember this is the user and allow all these things for him
-> as soon as the user logs in, our server talks to a JWT server (Json we token) to generate a token and give it to user and use it later for verification
